    "Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict continuous numerical values by modeling a linear relationship between independent variables and a dependent variable. The machine learning pipeline involves data collection, preprocessing, splitting data into training and testing sets, training the model, evaluating performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R² score, and interpreting the results. The model fits a best-fit line that minimizes prediction error, where coefficients indicate how much the target variable changes with a unit change in each feature, and the intercept represents the predicted value when all features are zero. Simple linear regression uses one feature, while multiple linear regression uses multiple features to potentially improve prediction accuracy."

    "The multiple linear regression model (Task 2) performs better than the single-feature model (Task 1) if it has a lower MSE and a higher R² score. This is because it uses several relevant features such as income, rooms, population, and location, which together provide more information about housing prices than just housing_median_age alone.\n",

    "This assignment applied the complete Machine Learning pipeline to predict housing prices using linear regression. The simple linear regression model, built using only housing_median_age, demonstrated a basic linear relationship but showed limited predictive performance since housing prices depend on multiple factors. The multiple linear regression model incorporated all relevant features and included preprocessing steps such as scaling and encoding, resulting in improved accuracy and better explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation successfully demonstrated both simple and multiple linear regression within a structured ML workflow. While the single-feature model was easier to interpret, the multiple-feature model provided better prediction performance by utilizing more information. Overall, the assignment strengthened understanding of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and interpretation of regression coefficients and intercepts."
